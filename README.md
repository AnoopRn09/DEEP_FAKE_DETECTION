Deepfake Detection Using Synthetic Media 
This repository hosts the complete implementation, analysis, and results of our mini-project titled "Deepfake Detection Using Synthetic Media". The project addresses the growing challenge of identifying AI-generated manipulated video content (deepfakes) that threaten the integrity of digital information.  

Key Features:  
- Sophisticated Model Architecture: Combines ResNeXt CNN for frame-level feature extraction with LSTM networks for temporal sequence analysis, enabling the detection of subtle inconsistencies in deepfake videos.  
- Diverse Training Datasets: Trained on a balanced and extensive dataset, including FaceForensics++, Deepfake Detection Challenge, and Celeb-DF, ensuring robustness across various types of manipulated content.  
- User-Friendly Interface: Developed an intuitive front-end application allowing users to upload videos and receive real-time classification results (real or fake) along with model confidence scores.  
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices, demonstrating strong performance in detecting deepfakes under real-world conditions.  
- Scalability and Security: Designed to handle large datasets and computational demands while ensuring secure handling of user-uploaded data.  

 System Workflow:  
1. Preprocessing: Videos are split into frames, and faces are detected and cropped for focused analysis.  
2. Feature Extraction: Frame-level features are extracted using ResNeXt CNN.  
3. Sequence Processing: Temporal patterns in video frames are analyzed using LSTM to classify videos as authentic or deepfake.  
4. Prediction: Outputs classification results with confidence levels, aiding users in verifying the authenticity of digital media.  

Results:  
- Achieved high accuracy and robustness, even for low-quality and challenging video inputs.  
- Demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating the spread of misinformation by providing reliable detection of manipulated content.  
- Graphs and snapshots of training and testing phases, confusion matrices, and classification outputs are included to visualize model performance.  

 Future Enhancements:  
- Expanding detection capabilities to include full-body deepfakes.  
- Development of a browser plugin for seamless detection in real-time applications.  

This repository represents a significant step toward safeguarding the digital landscape against deepfake-related misinformation and malicious activities. We welcome contributions and suggestions to further refine and expand this project.
